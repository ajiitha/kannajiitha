        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>You're right, all we have is right now. I guess 30 years isn't even guaranteed to say we'll get there when we're here.  But say we make it there, unscathed. You come home from work and I'm curled up on the couch writing in my diary waiting with dinner for you. Maybe I was too lazy and bought us some glizzys and pizza but I still waited because I hate eating alone. </p> 
            <p>We may not miss each other the way we do now but I know I'll miss you when you leave our bed before me, or while I haul myself out of your arms to make my morning coffee as you sleep in. I may not miss you the same all day, but I know I'll be excited to see you again at the end of every day. At the end of a long weekend away from each other. At the end of a fight we haven’t talked through yet. At the end of a busy day when our paths briefly go different ways. At the end of a quiet moment when words aren't needed, yet your presence speaks loudly. When I come home early and notice the absence of your shoes by the door. During a solo grocery run when I realize the dairy aisle next to the eggs feel incomplete without you. At the end of a movie night, wishing you were there to share the post-film recap. After a spontaneous midday nap when I wake up to find you're not there…just busy changing all the light bulbs in the house. Even in the mundane, everyday scenes, a subtle longing for you will always stay. Like you, I don’t know how but I just know.</p> 
<p>I’ll miss you every day because we'll be changing every day. We'll never be the same person because we love life and we love to grow, learn and simply live. Just like how the Ganen and Ajiitha we once knew all those years ago are not the same little kids. Always the same people but always evolving. Everything at once 💘🦋</p>

        <h2><span class="heart"> Reflections of my own 💭
(for all my connections)  </span></h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Reflection on Oversharing:</p>
<p>I've recently come to realize that my perspective on oversharing wasn't entirely accurate. While I used to believe that it was merely a matter of sharing with the right people, I now understand that it's more nuanced than that. Oversharing isn't just about the audience; it's about the nature and amount of information being shared.</p>
<p> Authenticity and Boundaries:</p>
<p>I used to equate authenticity with full disclosure, not realizing that being genuine doesn't mean sharing every detail of my life. I now see that oversharing can overwhelm others, especially if they are not prepared for a substantial amount of personal information. True authenticity involves striking a balance between openness and respecting boundaries.</p>
<p>Having gained these insights, I am committed to working on this part of myself. I want my communication to be thoughtful, considerate, and respectful of others' boundaries. I only caqre for genuine connections based on mutual understanding and shared experiences, rather than confusing oversharing for authenticity/intimacy.</p>
<p>Moving Forward:
I believe that by being more mindful of what and how I share, I can contribute to healthier and more authentic relationships. I want to create spaces where everyone feels comfortable and respected, fostering genuine connections built on trust and understanding.</p>

        <h2> <heart> My Ganen </heart> </h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Four months in and we’ve already grown so much. </p>
 <p> Every day I ask myself the same question and every day the answer still floors me. Ganen? From Mary Shadd? I never get sick of this thought, it's news to me every time. No signs, no compass or clues.
I always knew love would find its way to me organically, somehow, some way, in this lifetime...but not like this. Not with someone like you. Although I call myself a writer, even I can't put you into words. I appreciate you for doing your part every day. I see it and I feel it. I am grateful to have found someone not just as insightful as me but someone who brings new insight to me. You may not see it but you teach me new things every day just by being yourself. I consider different perspectives I normally wouldn’t have otherwise. I’ll tell you more about it in person (it’s in my therapy notes lmao!).  I love how open we can be with each other in just four months so I can’t wait to see the empire we build in four years, decades, eternity. You get me and the best part is, even when you don't I know you'll always try to.  </p>
 <p> Celebrating your 27th birthday with you was very special to me. Cooking for you and feeding you made me feel closer to you in a way I haven’t felt for you before. Watching you eat the food I made for you satisfied my hunger.  I never wanted to cook for someone so badly every single day. Giving to you feels like giving to me, like we’re pouring and drinking from the same glass. I served you on a banana leaf, you said you felt like a king but I felt like a queen. I still felt like your equal. Sure it’s because I love you but it’s also because you are so deserving. You appreciate every detail, you notice the unnoticed and you never fail to recognize love when you feel it. You speak my love language with fluency, and I always feel appreciated by you. </p>  <p> I just wanted to say babe, I’m impressed by the realizations, conversations and insight you’ve developed in your sessions. Lol you just having your notes with you and sharing with me makes me smile. It’s just so mature, so progressive and most of all it feels so fucking good. For both of us. I actually wanted to reach out to my therapist for a check in session, I’d want to do it more regularly once I’m working again. After your last session and our talk, I realized some things about myself that I want to work on (thanks to you, I learn about myself too.) I also wanted to thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts with me. It’s not easy to be vulnerable and talk about the past or how it may be affecting the present but it makes me really happy to hear it from you. It fills the gap, the distance that forms when you may be upset/moody + keeps my anxiety at bay. It means a lot when you share parts of yourself with me, big or small, I’m here for you and for us. I can't wait to see you again so we can cuddle, talk, kiss and simply coexist together. </p>

<p> The love and light of my life, you are. </p>  <p> With lots of eskimo kisses and snuggles </p> <p> Ajiitha </p>

        <h2>Miss you but I’m hurting babe</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Ganen,</p>
 
            <p> What hurts the most about Friday night is you seemed more worried about me causing a scene rather than the fact that your girl is on the balcony so she can cry without anyone hearing her. The reaction that you felt wasn’t warranted was me being hurt. It wasn’t a scene or just drama, that was my real feelings in that moment. I spent most of my childhood staying quiet and holding back tears. I finally started wearing my heart on my sleeve, like you. I wasn’t trying to cause a scene, I was just letting myself feel and I tried to remove myself from the situation. I got frustrated, couldn’t help but cry. I wanted to know what was wrong and I couldn’t figure it out. It’s okay to want to sleep, it’s okay to not want to talk about what’s upsetting you but it’s not okay to be cold and disrespect other people because of how you feel. Yes you can carry the night but there’s no love or power in that if you can shut it down for everyone else  just because you aren’t happy. I used to be just like that and I’ve hurt the people closest to me because of how selfishly I’d spread my energy, even when no one deserved it.  It’s a blessing yes but if you don’t know how to use your remote control then it’s a curse. Carry the night, be the life of the party but know how to carry yourself when the night’s got you down too. I tried until I got frustrated. Night got me down when I was already on the floor. 
</p>
 <p> Do you remember saying you felt like punching me in the face in front of Kieran and Sujana? </p>

<p> Why do you think she wanted me to feel safe? Why do you think she was acting like I’ve been hit before? Because I have. </p>

<p> I’m shocked, you told them I was upset because I “wasn’t getting dick tonight” what?? </p>
            <p> You know how we speak to each other, like equals. If you had talked to me the way you talk to Ajiitha, the Ajiitha you fell in love with, I would’ve dropped it. But the minute you’re upset, it doesn’t matter who’s in front of you. Your warmth disappears. You’re all ice. You don’t even have to say anything to be cold.  You can just feel it. That night, we all just wanted to make sure you were okay not just me. We were tipsy, tired and just confused as to what upset you. I just cared too much. We all did. I love you so much. Just because it’s not serious to you doesn’t mean it’s not serious to me or to anyone else. It’s not your world, it’s not my world, it’s all of ours. We are equals, we’re all here just trying to get through this life. I’m so scared to be in love, to lose it all, most of all I’m afraid to lose myself in it all. I’m afraid, just like you.  </p>

           <p> All I wanted was to talk to you with warmth.  All any of us wanted was to understand what upset you so we could help you feel better. I guess it’s hard to help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. I wish I listened and didn’t try to help, I just hate going to bed knowing something is wrong or you’re upset. I thought we both did. The following night i have no idea how you were able to go out to an event. I was so down.  I just feel hurt Ganen, really hurt but in the same breath, I miss us. It just hurts when you close me out, especially when I know who you are when you are open. </p>
                        <p> I just want to talk in person but I feel so low. I want to be held by you…just feel like I have no energy to hold you back. </p>
            <p> Miss your love, miss your touch, miss your softness, miss your smile and your scent. Miss the way you talk to me, look at me. I miss Ganen and Ajiitha. </p>
            <p>Always with love, </p>
<p>Ajiitha</p>

        <h2>Therapeutic notes 10/17/2023</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Ganen,</p>
            <p> I had my therapy session today with my girl, Kato, after a long time and it was so refreshing and grounding. It really reassures me that I'm using the tools I've gained correctly and I'm on a healthy path. </p>
            <p> She was so excited to hear that I'm in a new relationship that values me and I truly value.  I told her about us and how much you and I both want a future together. Felt nice to say out loud. </p>
            <p> Our relationship means a lot to me. I know I would have to face some of my anxiety/trauma in my relationships whether it's with you or someone else but I would very much have the man on my team be you. </p>
            <p> Reaching out to my therapist is a very mature and proactive approach I'm taking because I care about us. I want us to be happy and healthy, so I hope this helps you too. I love you. </p>
            <p> So I want to share with you what I learned from this session. I told Kato about our two conflicts and she had some interesting things to say that I didn't even consider...which is why I love her. I honestly love therapy, I have an epiphany every time lol. </p>
           <p> Some Notes: </p>
            <p> He is not the only one threatening to leave during conflict. I did it too. By telling him "if you react this way again, I will leave" or "I can't do this" is a threat!!  We both threaten the relationship out of fear of abandonment, fear of losing each other. 
<p> He threatens to leave before he’s left. </p> 
<p> I threaten to leave him if he doesn’t change. I did not realize I was also threatening the relationship. Both threats are fear-based. We don't actually want to leave. We just don't want to get hurt. </p>
<p> Saying “two strikes” to him is a threat. I can't do that.</p>
<p> In the heat of the moment, we don’t try to listen and help each other with our attachment styles and our fear of losing each other. Analogy - anger is a child - both our children are fighting. The adults return after the fight and we know what to say. 
Take a moment to calm down, remove ourselves from the situation before we say things we don't mean. Reconvene and talk as adults. </p>

<p> Three things you never do in an argument with your partner: </p>
<p> 1) No name calling, ever. </p> 
<p> 2) Do not say "always" or "never" example: "you always do this, you never do that!" </p>
<p> 3) Never threaten the relationship (which is what we are facing) threatening to leave, threatening with the gold chain. </p>
            
<p> When we start off at the North Pole (on top of the world), everywhere else is South. The fall from a pedestal is long and hard. 
Acknowledge we are both humans. We are both flawed. But flaws and conflict does not mean the end. It just means we are human and we need to work together for change because change does not happen right away. </p>
           <p> We are a team, we have to remind each other that conflicts does not mean it's the end. It's a chance to learn, observe and do better. We are still a new couple, it will take time as long as we can be patient with each other
               because we are worth it. </p>
            <p> So those are some notes and key points I learned from today's session which we'll talk about in person too. I just like writing here when we can't see each other hehe. Kato was very happy to hear I found you. She's even happier I came to her with this to tackle early on. 
            <p> Tbh the entire time I wish you were in the session too. I feel like you would have actually enjoyed it. </p>
            <p> Anyways babe, we can talk about this when I see you.</p>
            <p> I love you in so many ways. 
            <p>Forever your lil pumpkin, Ajiitha</p>

          <h2>Love Letter from Ajiitha 9/27/2023</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p> I still love you and I still see my whole life with you. I just don’t know how to trust you in future conflicts - will you run away again? I’m really hoping this was a one time emotional response. </p>
            <p>I just want to know why you were willing to call it quits over something we know is irrelevant to the both of us in the grand scheme of things. You have every right to feel uncomfortable, turned off and upset by the situation I will always support that…but it is different when you hurt your partner in the process. </p>
            <p>Forget your tone of voice, forget that you were upset - it’s the things you say that hurt and it hurts because I’m thinking of the future with you always. I don’t want to build resentment towards you. These little things, these little words add up and I know you know this. You and I both have been through the relationship wringer before, we know how it goes. If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all. Why? It’s just not productive, it doesn’t help us grow. It’s not walking on eggshells to be mindful of how you speak. Just because thats how you've always spoken doesn’t mean it’s right or deserving. I’m always open to improving who I am for us but only if it makes sense to. Telling someone to "have thicker skin" is problematic because it dismisses their emotions, shifts responsibility away from addressing harmful behaviour, and can perpetuate negative social norms. A more compassionate approach involves empathizing with their feelings and working together to address underlying issues constructively. I want this with you. Doing the emotional work means a lot to me, and I don’t think it’s a big ask. I think it’s something we all need to do as individuals to simply evolve as people - in a relationship or not. I want to make this work but I need you to meet me halfway and I’ll do the same for you. I know it won’t happen in a day, or a month or maybe even a year but if you can rise to the occasion, I can’t wait to see you there again.</p>
            <p>Forever your lil egg,</p>

            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p>Every moment we spend together is a treasure. I feel safest in your presence, and strongest with you by my side. You make a kind of happy I didn't know I could reach. </p>
            <p>From the first (second) time we met, I knew there was something special about you although I didn't want to admit it until our first date. Your smile, your touch, and your love have made my life complete.</p>
            <p>As we explore life together, I want you to know that you are my rock, my confidant, and my forever love.</p>
            <p>I love you more with each passing day, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Take care of yourself...so you can take care of me. Hehe jk I love you babe.</p>
