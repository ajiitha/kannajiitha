        <h2>Miss you but I’m hurting babe</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Ganen,</p>
 
            <p> I know you are hurt. I feel hurt too. What hurts me the most about Friday night is you seemed more worried about me causing a scene rather than the fact that I was hurt, crying. My reaction to your cold demeanor and dismissal wasn’t a scene or just drama, that "reaction" was my pain. I wanted to help and I felt shut out. I know I still have to work on managing my emotions because I'm aware I'm an emotionally charged individual and I feel very deeply. I'm not perfect but I always try to come to you with love, I wish I got that back. I saw the switch in your mood, I keep seeing a pattern. I wanted to help and you shut me out...I got frustrated, couldn’t help but cry. I wanted to know what upset you and I couldn’t figure it out. It's okay to want to sleep, it’s okay to not want to talk about what’s upsetting you but it’s not okay to be cold and disrespect other people because of how you feel. Not only did you minimize, invalidate and shame my emotional experience (my side of our coin), you assumed I played the victim card...completely neglecting my genuine feelings.  
                <p> I love that you can carry the night but there’s no love or power in that if you can shut it down for everyone else just because you aren’t happy. I used to be just like that (still working on it) and I’ve hurt the people closest to me because of how selfishly I’d spread my energy, even when no one deserved it.  It’s a blessing yes but if you don’t know how to use your remote control then it’s a curse. Carry the night, be the life of the party but know how to carry yourself when the night’s got you down too. I tried until I got frustrated. Night got me down when I was already on the floor. </p>
 <p> Do you remember saying you felt like punching me in the face in front of Sujana and Kieran? </p>

<p> Why do you think she wanted me to feel safe? Why do you think she was acting like I’ve been hit before? Because I have. </p>

<p> I’m shocked, you told them I was upset because I “wasn’t getting dick tonight” what?? </p>
            <p> You know how we speak to each other, like equals. But I guess you really believe that I don't have what it takes to be with you. If you had talked to me the way you talk to Ajiitha, the Ajiitha you fell in love with, I would’ve dropped it. But the minute you’re upset, it doesn’t matter who’s in front of you. Your warmth disappears. You’re all ice. You don’t even have to say anything to be cold.  You can just feel it. That night, we all just wanted to make sure you were okay not just me. We were tipsy, tired and just confused as to what upset you. I just cared too much. We all did. I love you so much. Just because it’s not serious to you doesn’t mean it’s not serious to me or to anyone else. It’s not your world, it’s not my world, it’s all of ours. We are equals, we’re all here just trying to get through this life. I’m so scared to be in love, to lose it all, most of all I’m afraid to lose myself in it all. I’m afraid, just like you.  </p>

           <p> All I wanted was to talk to you with warmth.  All any of us wanted was to understand what upset you so we could help you feel better. I guess it’s hard to help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. I wish I listened and didn’t try to help, I just hate going to bed knowing something is wrong or you’re upset. I thought we both did. The following night i have no idea how you were able to go out to an event. I was so down.  I just feel hurt Ganen, really hurt but in the same breath, I miss us. It just hurts when you close me out, especially when I know who you are when you are open. </p>
                        <p> I just want to talk in person but I feel so low. I want to be held by you…just feel like I have no energy to hold you back. </p>
            <p> Miss your love, miss your touch, miss your softness, miss your smile and your scent. Miss the way you talk to me, look at me. I miss Ganen and Ajiitha. </p>
            <p>Always with love, </p>
<p>Ajiitha</p>

        <h2>Therapeutic notes 10/17/2023</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Ganen,</p>
            <p> I had my therapy session today with my girl, Kato, after a long time and it was so refreshing and grounding. It really reassures me that I'm using the tools I've gained correctly and I'm on a healthy path. </p>
            <p> She was so excited to hear that I'm in a new relationship that values me and I truly value.  I told her about us and how much you and I both want a future together. Felt nice to say out loud. </p>
            <p> Our relationship means a lot to me. I know I would have to face some of my anxiety/trauma in my relationships whether it's with you or someone else but I would very much have the man on my team be you. </p>
            <p> Reaching out to my therapist is a very mature and proactive approach I'm taking because I care about us. I want us to be happy and healthy, so I hope this helps you too. I love you. </p>
            <p> So I want to share with you what I learned from this session. I told Kato about our two conflicts and she had some interesting things to say that I didn't even consider...which is why I love her. I honestly love therapy, I have an epiphany every time lol. </p>
           <p> Some Notes: </p>
            <p> He is not the only one threatening to leave during conflict. I did it too. By telling him "if you react this way again, I will leave" or "I can't do this" is a threat!!  We both threaten the relationship out of fear of abandonment, fear of losing each other. 
<p> He threatens to leave before he’s left. </p> 
<p> I threaten to leave him if he doesn’t change. I did not realize I was also threatening the relationship. Both threats are fear-based. We don't actually want to leave. We just don't want to get hurt. </p>
<p> Saying “two strikes” to him is a threat. I can't do that.</p>
<p> In the heat of the moment, we don’t try to listen and help each other with our attachment styles and our fear of losing each other. Analogy - anger is a child - both our children are fighting. The adults return after the fight and we know what to say. 
Take a moment to calm down, remove ourselves from the situation before we say things we don't mean. Reconvene and talk as adults. </p>

<p> Three things you never do in an argument with your partner: </p>
<p> 1) No name calling, ever. </p> 
<p> 2) Do not say "always" or "never" example: "you always do this, you never do that!" </p>
<p> 3) Never threaten the relationship (which is what we are facing) threatening to leave, threatening with the gold chain. </p>
            
<p> When we start off at the North Pole (on top of the world), everywhere else is South. The fall from a pedestal is long and hard. 
Acknowledge we are both humans. We are both flawed. But flaws and conflict does not mean the end. It just means we are human and we need to work together for change because change does not happen right away. </p>
           <p> We are a team, we have to remind each other that conflicts does not mean it's the end. It's a chance to learn, observe and do better. We are still a new couple, it will take time as long as we can be patient with each other
               because we are worth it. </p>
            <p> So those are some notes and key points I learned from today's session which we'll talk about in person too. I just like writing here when we can't see each other hehe. Kato was very happy to hear I found you. She's even happier I came to her with this to tackle early on. 
            <p> Tbh the entire time I wish you were in the session too. I feel like you would have actually enjoyed it. </p>
            <p> Anyways babe, we can talk about this when I see you.</p>
            <p> I love you in so many ways. 
            <p>Forever your lil pumpkin, Ajiitha</p>

            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p> I still love you and I still see my whole life with you. I just don’t know how to trust you in future conflicts - will you run away again? I’m really hoping this was a one time emotional response. </p>
            <p>I just want to know why you were willing to call it quits over something we know is irrelevant to the both of us in the grand scheme of things. You have every right to feel uncomfortable, turned off and upset by the situation I will always support that…but it is different when you hurt your partner in the process. </p>
            <p>Forget your tone of voice, forget that you were upset - it’s the things you say that hurt and it hurts because I’m thinking of the future with you always. I don’t want to build resentment towards you. These little things, these little words add up and I know you know this. You and I both have been through the relationship wringer before, we know how it goes. If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all. Why? It’s just not productive, it doesn’t help us grow. It’s not walking on eggshells to be mindful of how you speak. Just because thats how you've always spoken doesn’t mean it’s right or deserving. I’m always open to improving who I am for us but only if it makes sense to. Telling someone to "have thicker skin" is problematic because it dismisses their emotions, shifts responsibility away from addressing harmful behaviour, and can perpetuate negative social norms. A more compassionate approach involves empathizing with their feelings and working together to address underlying issues constructively. I want this with you. Doing the emotional work means a lot to me, and I don’t think it’s a big ask. I think it’s something we all need to do as individuals to simply evolve as people - in a relationship or not. I want to make this work but I need you to meet me halfway and I’ll do the same for you. I know it won’t happen in a day, or a month or maybe even a year but if you can rise to the occasion, I can’t wait to see you there again.</p>
            <p>Forever your lil egg,</p>

            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p>Every moment we spend together is a treasure. I feel safest in your presence, and strongest with you by my side. You make a kind of happy I didn't know I could reach. </p>
            <p>From the first (second) time we met, I knew there was something special about you although I didn't want to admit it until our first date. Your smile, your touch, and your love have made my life complete.</p>
            <p>As we explore life together, I want you to know that you are my rock, my confidant, and my forever love.</p>
            <p>I love you more with each passing day, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Take care of yourself...so you can take care of me. Hehe jk I love you babe.</p>
            <p>Forever yours,</p>
