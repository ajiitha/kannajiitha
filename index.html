     <h2>Therapy Notes that made me feel better and I hope it makes you feel better too 10/17/2023</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p> I had my therapy session today with my girl Kato after a long time and it was so refreshing and grounding. It really reassures me that I'm okay and I'm on a healthy path. </p>
            <p> Our relationship means a lot to me. I know I would have to face this in my next relationship whether its with you or someone else and I would very much have the man I'm working with be you. </p>
            <p> Reaching out to my therapist is a very mature and proactive approach I'm taking because I care about us. I want us to be happy and healthy, so I hope this helps you too. I love you </p>
            <p> I want to share with you. I told her about our two conflicts and she had some interesting things to say that I didn't even consider... </p>
            <p> He is not the only one threatening to leave during conflict. I did it too. We both threaten the relationship out of fear of abandonment, fear of losing each other. 

<p> He threatens to leaves before he’s left. </p> 
<p> I threaten to leave him if he doesn’t change. I did not realize I was also threatening the relationship. I am sorry, now I know. </p>
<p> Saying “two strikes” to him is a threat. I can't do that.</p>
<p> In the heat the moment, we don’t try to listen and help each other with our attachment styles and our fear of losing each other. Both our children are fighting. The adults return after the fight and we know what to say. We need to try and be adults for our children.
Take a moment to calm down, remove yourself out of the situation before we say things we don't mean. Reconvene and talk as adults. </p>

<p> Three things you never do in an argument with your partner: </p>
<p> 1) No name calling, ever. </p> 
<p> 2) Do not say "always" or "never" example: "you always do this, you never do that!" </p>
<p> 3) Never threaten the relationship (which is what we are facing) threatening to leave, threatening with the gold chain. </p>
<p> When we start off at the North Pole (on top of the world), everywhere else is South. The fall from a pedestal is long and hard. 
Acknowledge we are both humans. We are both flawed. But flaws and conflict does not mean the end. It just means we are human and we need to work together for change because change does not happen right away. </p>
            <p> So those are some notes and key points I learned from today's session. Kato was very happy to hear I found you. If I'm being honest, baby, if we could do one session together just to try it that would make
            me really happy, but I also think it would make you happy too. I just want to make sure we go about this in a healthy way from the start. Take your time, I'm not going anywhere.</p>

          <h2>Love Letter from Ajiitha 9/27/2023</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p> I still love you and I still see my whole life with you. I just don’t know how to trust you in future conflicts - will you run away again? I’m really hoping this was a one time emotional response. </p>
            <p>I just want to know why you were willing to call it quits over something we know is irrelevant to the both of us in the grand scheme of things. You have every right to feel uncomfortable, turned off and upset by the situation I will always support that…but it is different when you hurt your partner in the process. </p>
            <p>Forget your tone of voice, forget that you were upset - it’s the things you say that hurt and it hurts because I’m thinking of the future with you always. I don’t want to build resentment towards you. These little things, these little words add up and I know you know this. You and I both have been through the relationship wringer before, we know how it goes. If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all. Why? It’s just not productive, it doesn’t help us grow. It’s not walking on eggshells to be mindful of how you speak. Just because thats how you've always spoken doesn’t mean it’s right or deserving. I’m always open to improving who I am for us but only if it makes sense to. Telling someone to "have thicker skin" is problematic because it dismisses their emotions, shifts responsibility away from addressing harmful behaviour, and can perpetuate negative social norms. A more compassionate approach involves empathizing with their feelings and working together to address underlying issues constructively. I want this with you. Doing the emotional work means a lot to me, and I don’t think it’s a big ask. I think it’s something we all need to do as individuals to simply evolve as people - in a relationship or not. I want to make this work but I need you to meet me halfway and I’ll do the same for you. I know it won’t happen in a day, or a month or maybe even a year but if you can rise to the occasion, I can’t wait to see you there again.</p>

            <p>From the first (second) time we met, I knew there was something special about you although I didn't want to admit it until our first date. Your smile, your touch, and your love have made my life complete.</p>
