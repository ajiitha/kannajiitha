        <h2><span class="heart"> My Ganen </span></h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Four months in and we’ve already grown so much.</p>
            <p>Every day I ask myself the same question and every day the answer still shocks me. Ganen? From Mary Shadd? I never get sick of this thought; it's news to me every time. No signs, no compass or clues. I always knew love would find its way to me organically, somehow, some way, in this lifetime... but not like this. Not with someone like you. Although I call myself a writer, even I can't put you into words. I appreciate you for doing your part every day. I see it and I feel it. I am grateful to have found someone not just as insightful as me but someone who brings new insight to me. You may not see it, but you teach me new things every day just by being yourself. I consider different perspectives I normally wouldn’t have otherwise. I’ll tell you more about it in person (it’s in my therapy notes lol!). I love how open we can be with each other in just four months so I can’t wait to see the empire we build in four years, decades, eternity. You get me and the best part is, even when you don't, I know you'll always try to.</p>
            <p>Celebrating your 27th birthday with you was very special to me. Cooking for you and feeding you made me feel closer to you in a way I haven’t felt for you before. Watching you eat the food I made for you satisfied my hunger. I never wanted to cook for someone so badly every single day. Giving to you feels like giving to me, like we’re pouring and drinking from the same glass. I served you on a banana leaf; you said you felt like a king, but I felt like a queen. I still felt like your equal. Sure, it’s because I love you, but it’s also because you are so deserving. You appreciate every detail, you notice the unnoticed, and you never fail to recognize love when you feel it. You speak my love language with fluency, and I always feel appreciated by you.</p>
            <p>I just wanted to say babe, I’m impressed by the realizations, conversations, and insight you’ve developed in your sessions. Lol, you just having your notes with you and sharing with me makes me smile. It’s just so mature, so progressive, and most of all it feels so freaking good. For both of us. I actually wanted to reach out to my therapist for a check-in session; I’d want to do it more regularly once I’m working again. After your last session and our talk, I realized some things about myself that I want to work on (thanks to you, I learn about myself too.) I also wanted to thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts with me. It’s not easy to be vulnerable and talk about the past or how it may be affecting the present, but it makes me really happy to hear it from you. It fills the gap, the distance that forms when you may be upset/moody + keeps my anxiety at bay. It means a lot when you share parts of yourself with me, big or small, I’m here for you and for us.</p>
            <p>Love of my life, you are.</p>
            <p>With lots of eskimo kisses and cuddles</p>

        <h2>Therapeutic notes 10/17/2023</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Ganen,</p>
            <p> I had my therapy session today with my girl, Kato, after a long time and it was so refreshing and grounding. It really reassures me that I'm using the tools I've gained correctly and I'm on a healthy path. </p>
            <p> She was so excited to hear that I'm in a new relationship that values me and I truly value.  I told her about us and how much you and I both want a future together. Felt nice to say out loud. </p>
            <p> Our relationship means a lot to me. I know I would have to face some of my anxiety/trauma in my relationships whether it's with you or someone else but I would very much have the man on my team be you. </p>
            <p> Reaching out to my therapist is a very mature and proactive approach I'm taking because I care about us. I want us to be happy and healthy, so I hope this helps you too. I love you. </p>
            <p> So I want to share with you what I learned from this session. I told Kato about our two conflicts and she had some interesting things to say that I didn't even consider...which is why I love her. I honestly love therapy, I have an epiphany every time lol. </p>
           <p> Some Notes: </p>
            <p> He is not the only one threatening to leave during conflict. I did it too. By telling him "if you react this way again, I will leave" or "I can't do this" is a threat!!  We both threaten the relationship out of fear of abandonment, fear of losing each other. 
<p> He threatens to leave before he’s left. </p> 
<p> I threaten to leave him if he doesn’t change. I did not realize I was also threatening the relationship. Both threats are fear-based. We don't actually want to leave. We just don't want to get hurt. </p>
<p> Saying “two strikes” to him is a threat. I can't do that.</p>
<p> In the heat of the moment, we don’t try to listen and help each other with our attachment styles and our fear of losing each other. Analogy - anger is a child - both our children are fighting. The adults return after the fight and we know what to say. 
Take a moment to calm down, remove ourselves from the situation before we say things we don't mean. Reconvene and talk as adults. </p>

<p> Three things you never do in an argument with your partner: </p>
<p> 1) No name calling, ever. </p> 
<p> 2) Do not say "always" or "never" example: "you always do this, you never do that!" </p>
<p> 3) Never threaten the relationship (which is what we are facing) threatening to leave, threatening with the gold chain. </p>
            
<p> When we start off at the North Pole (on top of the world), everywhere else is South. The fall from a pedestal is long and hard. 
Acknowledge we are both humans. We are both flawed. But flaws and conflict does not mean the end. It just means we are human and we need to work together for change because change does not happen right away. </p>
           <p> We are a team, we have to remind each other that conflicts does not mean it's the end. It's a chance to learn, observe and do better. We are still a new couple, it will take time as long as we can be patient with each other
               because we are worth it. </p>
            <p> So those are some notes and key points I learned from today's session which we'll talk about in person too. I just like writing here when we can't see each other hehe. Kato was very happy to hear I found you. She's even happier I came to her with this to tackle early on. 
            <p> Tbh the entire time I wish you were in the session too. I feel like you would have actually enjoyed it. </p>
            <p> Anyways babe, we can talk about this when I see you.</p>
            <p> I love you in so many ways. 
            <p>Forever your lil pumpkin, Ajiitha</p>

            <p>Dear Kanna,</p>
            <p> I still love you and I still see my whole life with you. I just don’t know how to trust you in future conflicts - will you run away again? I’m really hoping this was a one time emotional response. </p>
            <p>I just want to know why you were willing to call it quits over something we know is irrelevant to the both of us in the grand scheme of things. You have every right to feel uncomfortable, turned off and upset by the situation I will always support that…but it is different when you hurt your partner in the process. </p>
            <p>Forget your tone of voice, forget that you were upset - it’s the things you say that hurt and it hurts because I’m thinking of the future with you always. I don’t want to build resentment towards you. These little things, these little words add up and I know you know this. You and I both have been through the relationship wringer before, we know how it goes. If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all. Why? It’s just not productive, it doesn’t help us grow. It’s not walking on eggshells to be mindful of how you speak. Just because thats how you've always spoken doesn’t mean it’s right or deserving. I’m always open to improving who I am for us but only if it makes sense to. Telling someone to "have thicker skin" is problematic because it dismisses their emotions, shifts responsibility away from addressing harmful behaviour, and can perpetuate negative social norms. A more compassionate approach involves empathizing with their feelings and working together to address underlying issues constructively. I want this with you. Doing the emotional work means a lot to me, and I don’t think it’s a big ask. I think it’s something we all need to do as individuals to simply evolve as people - in a relationship or not. I want to make this work but I need you to meet me halfway and I’ll do the same for you. I know it won’t happen in a day, or a month or maybe even a year but if you can rise to the occasion, I can’t wait to see you there again.</p>
            <p>Forever your lil egg,</p>

            <p>From the first (second) time we met, I knew there was something special about you although I didn't want to admit it until our first date. Your smile, your touch, and your love have made my life complete.</p>
            <p>As we explore life together, I want you to know that you are my rock, my confidant, and my forever love.</p>
            <p>I love you more with each passing day, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Take care of yourself...so you can take care of me. Hehe jk I love you babe.</p>
